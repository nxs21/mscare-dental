MSCare Dental Clinic - patient website (PHP)

Run it
  1. Copy this folder into C:\xampp\htdocs\  (name it "mscare_users")
  2. Start Apache in XAMPP
  3. Open http://localhost/mscare_users/

Pages: index.php (Home), about.php, services.php, contact.php, book.php (Book Appointment)
Clinic info (phone, addresses, days, services, team) lives in config.php - edit it once and every page updates.
Contact messages and appointment requests are saved in PostgreSQL (see below).

Images
  All pictures live in the images folder as .jpg files. Replace any file with your own photo using the same file name and the site updates.
    home-team.jpg            Home page photo
    about-hero.jpg           About Us banner (also used behind Vision / Mission / Values)
    dr-carino.jpg            Dr. Cariño portrait
    nina-clemente.jpg        Nina Clemente portrait
    services-hero.jpg        Services banner
    service-<name>.jpg       One photo per service (service-general-dentistry.jpg, service-cleaning.jpg,
                             service-orthodontics.jpg, service-esthetic-dentistry.jpg, service-prosthodontics.jpg,
                             service-root-canal-treatment.jpg, service-oral-surgery.jpg, service-braces.jpg)
  The current pictures are example placeholders.
  Image file names and the About page text (dentist story, vision, mission, values) are set in config.php.


PostgreSQL setup
  1. Install PostgreSQL and create the database + tables:
        psql -U postgres -f database/schema.sql
     (or in pgAdmin: open database/schema.sql in the Query Tool and run it; run the CREATE DATABASE
      line first, connect to "mscare", then run the rest)
  2. In XAMPP open php.ini (XAMPP Control Panel > Apache > Config > PHP (php.ini)) and make sure these
     two lines have no semicolon in front, then restart Apache:
        extension=pdo_pgsql
        extension=pgsql
  3. Open includes/db.php and set your host / port / database / user / password
     (defaults: localhost, 5432, mscare, postgres, postgres).
  4. database/queries.sql has ready-made statements to view requests, confirm / cancel / reschedule,
     and read contact messages.

  Tables: branches, services, appointments, contact_messages.
  A date + time can be held only once (one dentist for both clinics); cancelling a request frees the slot.

Email verification (sender setup - no code editing)
  1. Log in to the admin site > Settings > Email Sender.
  2. Enter the clinic's sender email + its App Password (Gmail: myaccount.google.com/apppasswords), then "Save & test".
  3. Done. Patients can register with ANY email address and will receive their 6-digit code from that sender.
